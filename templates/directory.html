<h4>About Me</h4>
<h5>I am consistently working on finding ways to improve myself by seeking feedback from others and reflecting on my current goals. I have been able to give both positive and negative feedback while paying close attention to detail in a unique position for work. I enjoy working with people and in teams due to the unexpected challenges that arise and the unique perspectives others provide. I look for ways to challenge myself in new ways. As I have learned more about myself, I have found a passion for data. There is a story to be told and I have found many ways to do so. I am competitive by nature and strive to be the best at what I do. As I approach the last year of my time at Utah State, I look forward to applying what I have learned and seeing what experiences I can learn from moving forward. 
I have realized through experience that I enjoy working with information systems like Python, SQL, and Alteryx because of both the challenge it presents and the level of creativity it allows me to express. I look forward to the next step. I am eager to prove myself and my abilities.</h5>
